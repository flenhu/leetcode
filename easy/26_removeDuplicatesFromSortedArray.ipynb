    "# 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates **in-place** such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in `nums`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the number of unique elements of `nums` to be `k`. To get accepted, you need to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Change the array `nums` such that the first `k` elements of `nums` contain the unique elements in the order they were present in `nums` initially.\n",
    "2. The remaining elements of `nums` are not important, nor is the size of `nums`.\n",
    "3. Return `k`."

    "- **Sorted Input**: The input array is sorted in non-decreasing order, which is a major hint that you can solve this problem efficiently.\n",

    "- **Pointer Incrementation**: Decide when and how to move your pointers. In this case, you would move one pointer every time and another only when a unique element is found."
