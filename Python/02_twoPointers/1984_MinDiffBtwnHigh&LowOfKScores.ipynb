    "# Approach: Sliding Window\n",
    "For this problem, using a sliding window approach works best since we want to sort the array and then slide a window of size `k` across the array to find the minimum difference between the max and min values within that window.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intuition\n",
    "- By sorting the array, we ensure that the scores are in ascending order.\n",
    "- This arrangement allows us to only consider contiguous segments of `k` scores to find the minimum difference.\n",
    "- The sorted order guarantees that the difference between the first and last elements in any `k`-sized segment will be the smallest possible for that segment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm\n",
    "1. Sort the array in non-decreasing order.\n",
    "2. Initialize two pointers (or indices) to represent the window's start and end (`l=0` and `r=k-1`).\n",
    "3. Initialize a variable `res` to store the minimum difference found, setting it to a large value initially.\n",
    "4. Iterate over the array with the window:\n",
    "    - Update `res` with the minimum values between its current value and the difference `nums[r] - nums[l]`.\n",
    "    - Slide the window by incrementing both `l` and `r` by 1.\n",
    "5. Continue until `r` reaches the end of the array.\n",
    "6. Return the minimum difference found by `res`.\n"
