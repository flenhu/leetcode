    "# Approach: Two Pointers\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intuition\n",
    "- The two pointer approach is suitable for this problem because it lets us simultaneously traverse both of the strings `word1` and `word2`.\n",
    "- By using a pointer for each string, we can alternate between appending characters from each string to the result, effectively merging them in the desired pattern.\n",
    "## Algorithm\n",
    "1. Initialize two pointers, `i` and `j`, at the start of `word1` and `word2` respectively.\n",
    "2. Create an empty list, `res`, to store the characters of the merged string.\n",
    "3. Iterate over `word1` and `word2` as long as both pointers `i` and `j` are within the bounds of their respective strings:\n",
    "    - Append `word1[i]` to `res`.\n",
    "    - Append `word2[i]` to `res`.\n",
    "    - Increment both `i` and `j`.\n",
    "4. After the loop, append the remaining characters of `word1` (if any) and `word2` (if any) to `res`.\n",
    "5. Convert res to a string and return it."
