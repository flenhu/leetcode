    "# Approach 1: Fast and Slow Pointer \n",
    "- This approach is a variation of the two pointer technique as it uses two pointers to traverse the array:\n",
    "    - a fast pointer that explores the array to find non-zero elements\n",
    "    - a slow pointer that tracks the position of where the next non-zero element should be moved.\n",
    "- This approach ensures that all non-zero elements are shifted to the beginning of the array in their original order, with zeros moved to the end.\n",
    "\n",

    "- The intuition behind this approach is that by using two pointers, we can efficiently separate non-zero elements from zeros without needing additional space for storage.\n",
    "- The slow pointer indicates the position ready to recieve a non-zero element, ensuring non-zero elements are staying in order relative to each other, while the fast pointer searches for the non-zero elements.\n",

    "1. Initalize a slow pointer at the start of the array to indicate the position for a non-zero element.\n",
    "2. Iterate through the array with a fast pointer:\n",
    "    - When the fast pointer encounters a non-zero element and the slow pointer is at zero, swap their values.\n",
    "    - If the element at the slow pointer is non-zero, increment the slow pointer to find the next zero.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Approach 1: Fast & Slow Pointers\n",
    "- This approach uses two pointers to efficiently filter the non-zero elements by directly swapping zero elements encountered by the fast pointer with non-zero elements identified by the slow pointer. This approach excels in minimizing operations by levaraging the array's existing order and avoiding unnecessary moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach 2: Pop & Append\n",
    "- This approach iteratively scans the array, popping zero elements and appending them to the end as they are encountered. While this approach is straightforward and intuitive, it uses costly array modifications for each zero element found.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why the two pointer approach is the move\n",
    "- **Efficiency:** The fast and slow pointer approach directly places each non-zero element in its correct position with minimal operations, thus the time complexity is only $O(n)$ since it ensures each element is only visited at most twice.\n",
    "- **Reduced element shifting:** Unlike the pop and append method, which involves shifting many elements multiple times, the \"Fast and slow\" pointer approach minimizes element movement, thus is a bit faster."
