    "### Problem Explanation\n",
    "This problem requires us to compute the number of `1` bits in the binary representation of every number from 0 to `n`. This can be viewed as a follow-up for the the [Number of 1 Bits]() problem where we needed to count the bits of an unsigned integer. The goal here is to populate and return an array where each element at index `i` contains the count of `1` bits in the binary representation of `i`.\n",

    "# Approach: DP with Last Set Bit\n",
    "This problem uses dynamic programming to build up the solution iteratively. The main idea is to use previously computed results to efficiently calculate the Hamming weight for the next numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuition\n",
    "- Each number can be seen as an increment from previous numbers with a known count of `1` buts.\n",
    "- The number of `1` bits in a number is related to its previous numbers. \n",
    "    - Specifically, any number `x` is either a power of 2(in which case it has a one `1` bit) or it can be represented as `y + z`, where `y` is the most recent power of 2 less than `x`, and `x` is a previously encountered number.\n",
    "    - The number of `1` bits in `x` is then 1(for the `1` bit in `y`) plus the number of `1` bits in `z`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm\n",
    "1. Initialize an array `dp` of length `n + 1` with zeroes. This array will store the count of `1` bits for each number from 0 to `n`.\n",
    "2. Initialize `offset` to 1, representing the most recent power of 2 encountered.\n",
    "3. Iterate over the range from 1 to `n`.\n",
    "    - If `i` is a power of 2, update `offset` to `i`\n",
    "    - The number of `1` bits in `i` is 1(for the `1` bit in `offset`) plus the number of `1` bits in `i - offset`.\n",
    "    - Update `dp[i]` accordingly.\n",
    "4. Return the populated `dp` array\n",
