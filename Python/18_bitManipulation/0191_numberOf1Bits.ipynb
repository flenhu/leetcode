    "### Problem Explanation\n",
    "- This problem is also known as the Hamming weight problem, which requires us to count the number of `1` bits in the binary representation of an unsigned integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Approach: Bit Manipulation\n",
    "- The efficient approach to solve this problem is to repeatedly flip the least significant `1` bit of the number to `0` and count how many we perform this operation until the number becomes zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuition\n",
    "- The key idea here is that for any binary number `n`, the expression `n - 1` flips the least significant `1` bit of `n` to `0` and all the 0 bits to the right of this `1` but to `1`.\n",
    "- When we perform a bitwise AND between `n` and `n - 1`, it effectively remove the least significant `1` bit from `n`.\n",
    "- Repeating this process gives us the count of `1` bits in the binary representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm\n",
    "1. Initialize a counter `res` to 0.\n",
    "2. While `n` is not 0:\n",
    "    - Perform a bitwise AND between `n` and `n - 1` and assign the result back to `n`. This operation removes the least significant `1` bit from `n`.\n",
    "    - Increment the counter `res` by 1.\n",
    "3. Return the counter `res` as the total number of `1`\n",
