    "Implement a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack using only two queues. The implemented stack should support all the functions of a normal stack (`push`, `top`, `pop`, and `empty`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the `MyStack` class:\n",
    "- `void push(int x)` Pushes element `x` to the top of the stack.\n",
    "- `int pop()` Removes the element on the top of the stack and returns it.\n",
    "- `int top()` Returns the element on the top of the stack.\n",
    "- `boolean empty()` Returns `true` if the stack is empty, `false` otherwise.\n",

    "#### Notes:\n",
    "- You must use **only** standard operations of a queue, which means that only `push to back`, `peek/pop from front`, `size`, and `is empty` operations are valid.\n",

    "# Approach 1: One Queue (_Push - $O(n)$, Pop - $O(1)$_) \n",
    "We can first try approaching this problem by using a single queue to implement a stack which involves manipulating the order of element within the queue whenever a new element is added (`push` operation), to ensure that the alst added element can be retrieved first, which adheres to the stack's **LIFO** principle.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intuition\n",
    "- The key intuition here is that by requiring elements already in the queue in a specific manner after adding a new element, you can maintain the order necessary for stack operations.\n",
    "- More specifically, after inserting a new element at the end of the queue, you can move all elements that were in the queue before it to the back of the queue in their original order, effectively placing the new element at the front of the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm\n",
    "1. **Initialize:** Create an empty queue `q` to store the stack elements.\n",
    "2. **Push:**\n",
    "    - Append the new element `x` to the queue.\n",
    "    - Rotate the queue by dequeing (_popping from the front_) and enqueing (_appending to the back_) all element excepty the newlty added element. This effectively moves the new element to the front of the queue.\n",
    "3. **Pop:** Simply dequeue (_pop from the front_) the first element, which is the last pushed element due to the rotation performed during `push`.\n",
    "4. **Top:** Similar to `pop`, but after getting the front element, re-enqueue it to preserve the stack's state.\n",

    "# Shortcut Approach: Direct Use of Deque as a Stack\n",
    "- This approach definitely doesn't follow the nature of the problem (which is to simulate a stack behavior using queue operations), but it directly uses Python's `deque` to mimic a stack. \n",
    "- Python's `deque` supports both queue and stack operations, so its pretty straightforward to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intuition\n",
    "- The idea behind doing this approach is to leverage the fast that a deque (a double-ended queue) supports $O(1)$ time complexity for both append and pop operations at both ends. \n",
    "- By using the `append` method for push and the `pop` method (_which operates on the end of the deque_) for pop, we're essentially using the deque as a stack. \n",
    "- This approach is also not a proper solution to doing the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm\n",
    "1. **Initialization:** Create a `deque` object to store stack elements.\n",
    "2. **Push(x):** Append `x` to the end of the deque, which will serve as the top of the stack.\n",
    "3. **Pop():** Pop and return the last element of the deque (_top element of the stack_), ensuring the operations is only done when the deque is not empty.\n",
    "4. **Top():** Return the last element of the deque without removing it, acting as the top element of the stack.\n",
    "5. **Empty():** Check if the deque is empty."

    "## Conclusion: Implementing Stack using Queues\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach #1: One Queue (Push - $O(n)$, Pop - $O(1)$)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Summary**: This method uses a single queue where each `push` operation involves rotating the queue to maintain the last pushed element at the front, ensuring O(1) `pop` and `top` operations.\n",
    "- **Pros**: Simplifies the implementation by using only one queue.\n",
    "- **Cons**: The `push` operation is less efficient due to the need to rotate the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach #2: Two Queues (Push - O(1), Pop O(n))\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Summary**: Utilizes two queues, where one queue is used to store new elements and the other is used to reverse the order during `pop` or `top` operations, ensuring the last element can be accessed directly.\n",
    "- **Pros**: Offers O(1) time complexity for the `push` operation.\n",
    "- **Cons**: `Pop` and `top` operations are less efficient, requiring elements to be transferred between queues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach #3: Two Queues (Push - O(n), Pop O(1))\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Summary**: In this variation, elements are pushed into an empty queue and then all elements from the other queue are transferred to this queue, ensuring the newly pushed element remains at the front. This setup allows for O(1) `pop` and `top` operations.\n",
    "- **Pros**: Optimizes for fast `pop` and `top` operations.\n",
    "- **Cons**: The `push` operation becomes less efficient due to transferring elements between queues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison and Recommendation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: Approach #1 and Approach #3 optimize for different operations. Approach #1 offers an efficient `pop` operation at the cost of a slower `push`, while Approach #3 does the opposite.\n",
    "- **Complexity**: Approach #1 is simpler in terms of conceptual understanding and implementation, as it only requires managing a single queue.\n",
    "- **Use Case**: The choice between these approaches depends on the expected usage pattern. If `pop` operations are more frequent and performance-critical than `push`, Approach #1 might be preferable. Conversely, if efficient `push` operations are more critical, Approach #3 could be better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these considerations, **Approach #1 (One Queue, push - O(n), pop O(1))** might be considered the best overall due to its simplicity and the typical use case of stacks where `pop` operations are as critical, if not more so, than `push` operations. Their optimization for quick `pop` and `top` operations aligns well with the common use cases of stacks, where accessing and removing the top element are frequent operations."
