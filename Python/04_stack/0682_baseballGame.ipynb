    "# Approach: Stack\n",
    "Using a stack is the most straightforward way to approach this problem. A stacj lets us easily add, double, sum, or remove scores according to the operations, which maintains the correct order of scores as we process through each operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intuition\n",
    "A stack is ideal for this scenario because the last operation often depends on the most recent score, which follows the principle of LIFO (_**Last In, First Out**_), and works especially well for the `\"+\"`, `\"D\"`, and `\"C\"` operations. By pushing scores onto the stack and popping them off as needed, we have an easy way to manage the dynamic list of scores. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm\n",
    "1. Initialize an empty list, let's call it `score_stack`, to act as the stack.\n",
    "2. Iterate through each operation in `operations`:\n",
    "    - If the operation is `\"+\"`, check of the stack has at least two scores, sum the last two, and push the sum onto the stack.\n",
    "    - If the operations is `\"D\"`, check if there's at least one score, double the last score, and push it onto the stack.\n",
    "    - If the operation is `\"C\"`, check if there's at least one score, and pop the last score from the stack.\n",
    "    - Otherwise, the opreation is a score `x`. Convert `x` to an integer and push it onto the stack.\n",
    "3. After processing all operations, sum the scores in the stack and get the total score."
