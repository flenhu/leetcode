    "You are keeping the scores for a baseball game with strange rules. At the beginning of the game, you start with an empty record.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a list of strings `operations`, where `operations[i]` is the `i-th` operation you must apply to the record and is one of the following:\n",
    "- An integer `x`.\n",
    "  - Record a new score of `x`.\n",
    "- `'+'`.\n",
    "  - Record a new score that is the sum of the previous two scores.\n",
    "- `'D'`.\n",
    "  - Record a new score that is the double of the previous score.\n",
    "- `'C'`.\n",
    "  - Invalidate the previous score, removing it from the record.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the sum of all the scores on the record after applying all the operations.\n",

    "> **Explanation:**  \n",
    "> `\"5\"` - Add `5` to the record, record is now `[5]` .    \n",
    "> `\"2\"` - Add `2` to the record, record is now `[5, 2]` .  \n",
    "> `\"C\"` - Invalidate and remove the previous score, record is now `[5]` .  \n",
    "> `\"D\"` - Add $2 \\cdot 5 = 10$ to the record, record is now `[5, 10]` .  \n",

    "> `\"+\"` - Add $-4 + 9 = 5$ to the record, record is now `[5, -2, -4, 9, 5]` .  \n",
    "> `\"+\"` - Add $9 + 5 = 14$ to the record, record is now `[5, -2, -4, 9, 5, 14]` .  \n",
    "> The **total sum** is $5 + (-2) + (-4) + 9 + 5 + 14 = \\bf{27}$.\n",
