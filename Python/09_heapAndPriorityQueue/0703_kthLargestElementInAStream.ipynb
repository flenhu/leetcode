    "### 1.3 Complexity Analysis\n",
    "- #### Time Complexity: $O(n \\log n)$ \n",
    "    - The time complexity has two main components: the complexity of initializing the `KthLargest` class and the complexity of the `add` method.\n",
    "        1. Initializing the `KthLargest` Class:\n",
    "            - **Heapifying the Array**:\n",
    "                - The initial heapification of the array `nums` takes $O(n)$ time, where N is the length of nums. \n",
    "                - This operation is what transforms the array into a heap.\n",
    "            - **Reducing the Heap to Size k**:\n",
    "                - After heapification, we need to ensure the heap size is exactly `k`. This involves popping elements from the heap until its size is `k`.\n",
    "                - In the worst case, this would require popping $n - k$ elements.\n",
    "                - Popping an element from a heap has a time complexity of $O(\\log n)$ (since after removing the top element, the heap needs to reorder itself.\n",
    "                - Therefore, doing this $n -k$ times results in a time complexity of $O((n-k)logn)$.\n",
    "                - However, since $k$ can be as small as 1, we consider the worst scenario, which roughly balances out to a complexity of $O(n \\log n)$\n",
    "                - Combining these, the total time complexity of the `KthLargest` class is $O(n +n \\log n) = o(n \\log n)$\n",
    "        2. Adding an Element (`add` method):\n",
    "            - **Adding and Potentially Removing an Element**:\n",
    "                - Each call to `add` may involve adding one element to the heap and potentially removing one element (to maintain the heap size at k). Both adding and removing an elment in a heap of size k have a time complexity of $O(\\log k)$.\n",
    "            - **Multiple adds**:\n",
    "                - If there are M calls to the `add` method, the total time complexity for all `add` operations combined is $O(m \\log k)$\n",
    "    - #### Overall Time Complexity:\n",
    "        - Combining the time complexity of the `Kthlargest` constructor and the `add` method, the overall time complexity becomes $`O(n \\log n + m \\log k)$, where:\n",
    "            - $n$ is the size of the initial array `nums`\n",
    "            - $m$ is the number of calls to the `add` method.\n",
    "            - $k$ is the specified rank for the kth largest element.\n",
    "            \n",
    "\n",
    "- #### Space Complexity: $O(k) \\approx O(n)$\n",
    "    - The space complexity is basically $O(k)$ since the heap is maintained with at most $k$ elements."
