    "# 27. Remove Element\n",
    "Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `val`, your task is to remove all occurrences of `val` in `nums` in-place. The order of the remaining elements may be changed. You should then return the number of elements in `nums` which are not equal to `val`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Let the number of elements in `nums` which are not equal to `val` be `k`. To get your solution accepted, you need to do the following things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Modify the array `nums` such that the first `k` elements of `nums` contain the elements which are not equal to `val`. \n",
    "2. The remaining elements of `nums` are not important.\n",
    "3. Return `k`."

    "**Output:**  \n",

    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2. It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).\n",
