    "This problem requires us to find the maximum depth (or height) of a binary tree. The depth of a binary tree is the number of node along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node. We can traverse a tree in a couple manners either by Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS.)\n",

    "- In a recursive DFS approach, we use the call stack to explore each path down the tree.\n",

    "- The depth of a binary tree is the maximum depth of its left and right subtrees plus one (for the root node itself).\n",
    "- If a node is `null`, it contributes a depth of 0.\n",
