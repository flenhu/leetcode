    "### Problem Explanation\n",
    "This problem requires us to find the maximum depth (or height) of a binary tree. The depth of a binary tree is the number of node along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node. We can traverse a tree in a couple manners either by Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS.)"

    "## Approach 1: Recursive DFS\n",
    "- Let's start with Depth-First Search, which explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.\n",
    "- In a recursive DFS approach, we use the call stack to explore each path down the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuition\n",
    "- The depth of a binary tree is the maximum depth of its left and right subtrees plus one (for the root node itself).\n",
    "- If a node is `null`, it contributes a depth of 0.\n",
    "- By recursively calculating the depth of a node as the maximum depth of its left and right children plus one, we can then figure out the maximum depth of the entire tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm\n",
    "1. **Base Case**: If the current node(`root`) is `null`, return a depth of 0.\n",
    "2. **Recursive Calls**: Recursively find the depth of the left and right subtrees.\n",
    "3. **Calculate Depth:** The depth at the current node is 1 (for the current node) plus the maximum depths of the left and right subtrees\n",
    "4. **Return Depth**: Return the calculated depth"
