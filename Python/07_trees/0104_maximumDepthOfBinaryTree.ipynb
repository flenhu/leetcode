The depth of a binary tree is the number of node along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node. We can traverse a tree in a couple manners either by Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS.)\n",

    "- In a recursive DFS approach, we use the call stack to explore each path down the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuition\n",
    "- The depth of a binary tree is the maximum depth of its left and right subtrees plus one (for the root node itself).\n",
    "- If a node is `null`, it contributes a depth of 0.\n",
    "- By recursively calculating the depth of a node as the maximum depth of its left and right children plus one, we can then figure out the maximum depth of the entire tree.\n",

    "## Last word - Comparison of Approaches\n",

    "\n",
    "### Recursive DFS\n",
    "- **Nature**: Pretty intuitive and straightforward.\n",
    "- **How It Works**: Recursively traverses down the tree, adding one for each level fo depth until it reaches a leaf node, then backtracks.\n",
    "- **Pros**: Simple and concise code\n",
    "- **Cons**: Uses system call stack for recursion, which can be a limitation for very deep trees (risk of stack overflow)\n",
    "- **Complexity Analysis**: Time: $O(n)$, Space: $O(h)$ where $h$ is the height of the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Iterative DFS\n",
    "- **Nature**: Similar to the recursive DFS approach but uses an explicit stack.\n",
    "- **How It Works**: Manually manages a stack to traverse the tree, tracking the depth of each node.\n",
    "- **Pros**: Avoids the potential stack overflow issues of recursive DFS, more control over the traversal process\n",
    "- **Cons**: Slightly more complex to implement\n",
    "- **Complexity Analysis**: Time: $O(n)$, Space: $O(h)$ where $h$ is the height of the tree in the worst case.\n",
    "\n",
    "### BFS (Breadth-First Search)\n",
    "- **Nature**: Level-order traversal.\n",
    "- **How It Works**: Uses a queue to explore each level of the tree before going deeper.\n",
    "- **Pros**: Naturally suited for problems related to levels or depth, since it processes one level at a time.\n",
    "- **Cons**: Can consume more memory than DFS when the tree is side since it stores all nodes at a given in the queue.\n",
    "- **Complexity Analysis**: Time: $O(n)$, Space: $O(n)$ in the worst case when the tree is a complete binary tree\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimal Approach\n",
    "- **In most scenarios**: Any of the approaches shuold be fine for most binary trees, since they share the same time complexity of $O(n)$\n",
    "- **Very Deep Trees**: Iterative DFS or Breadth-First Search (BFS) are preferable to avoid stack overflow issues\n",
    "- **Very Wide Trees**: Recursive or Iterative DFS might be more space efficient than BFS.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "- Each method has its unique advantages, they all efficiently acomplish the task of finding the maximum depth/height of a binary tree. \n",
    "- The choice ultimately depends on the specific characteristics of the tree in question and the limitations (like stack size) of the environment in which the algorithm is run in."
