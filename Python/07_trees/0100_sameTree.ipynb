    "# Approach: Recursion\n",
    "Using recursion is the most natural and straightforward approach to tackling this problem. We can compare corresponding nodes of both trees simulataneously and recursively check their subtrees.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuition\n",
    "- The base case is when both nodes are `null`, which would mean that the trees are identical up to that point.\n",
    "- When checking two nodes, there are three conditions to consider:\n",
    "    1. Both nodes are `null` (trees are identical up to this point.)\n",
    "    2. Both nodes are not `null`, and their values are equal (proceed to check their left and right children).\n",
    "    3. One node is `null` and the other is not, or their values are different (trees are not the same).\n",
    "- If at any point the trees fail to meet these criteria, we can conclude that the trees are not the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm\n",
    "1. **Check for Base Case**: If both nodes `p` and `q` are `null`, return `True`.\n",
    "2. **Check for Node Equality:** If both nodes are not `null` and their values are equal, recursively check:\n",
    "    - If `p.left` is the same as `q.left`.\n",
    "    - If `p.right` is the same as `q.right`.\n",
    "3. **Return False Otherwise**: If the nodes don't meet the above criteria, return `False`.\n",
    "4. **Combine Checks**: The trees are the same if both the left and right subtrees are the same."
