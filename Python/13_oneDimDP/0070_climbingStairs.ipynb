    "### 1.1 Intuition\n",
    "- This problem is a classical dynamic programming problem, where we want to break down the problem into smaller and more manageable subproblems.\n",
    "- The key intuition here is to recognize that thenumber of ways to steo `i` is the sum of the ways to reach step `i-1` and step `i-2`. This is because from step `i-1`, we can take one step to reach `i`, and from `i-2` we can take two steps to reach `i`.\n",
    "- This problem can essentially be solved by building up the number of ways to reach each step from the bottom of the staircase.\n",

    "    - Store `k` and initialize a min-heap with the given `nums` array.\n",

    "2. Adding a New Element:\n",
    "    - Push the new element (`val`) into the heap.\n",
    "    - If the heap size exceeds `k`, pop the smallest element.\n",
