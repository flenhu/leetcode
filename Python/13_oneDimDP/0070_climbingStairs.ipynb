    "# Approach 1: Dynamic Programming (bottom up)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Intuition\n",
    "- This problem is a classical dynamic programming problem, where we want to break down the problem into smaller and more manageable subproblems.\n",
    "- The key intuition here is to recognize that thenumber of ways to steo `i` is the sum of the ways to reach step `i-1` and step `i-2`. This is because from step `i-1`, we can take one step to reach `i`, and from `i-2` we can take two steps to reach `i`.\n",
    "- This problem can essentially be solved by building up the number of ways to reach each step from the bottom of the staircase.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Algorithm\n",
    "1. **Base Cases**: If `n` is 1,2, or 3, return `n` directly as the answer is straightforward.\n",
    "    - If `n = 1`, there is only 1 way to climb the stair. (1 step)\n",
    "    - If `n = 2`, there are 2 ways to climb the stairs. (1 step + 1 step, or 2 steps)\n",
    "    - If `n = 3`, there are 3 ways to climb the stairs.  \n",
    "        (1 step + 1 step + 1 step, or 1 step + 2 steps, or 2 steps + 1 step)\n",
    "2. **Iterative Approach**: For `n > 3`, we then need to calculate the number of ways dynamically based on the base cases and iteratively calculate the number of ways to reach eaach step up to `n`\n",
    "    - Use two variables (`n1` and `n2`) to store the number of ways to reach the previous two steps.\n",
    "    - Update the variables as we calculate the number of ways for each subsequent step."

    "3. **Recursive Calls**: For a given step `n`, if the number of ways to reach this step is not already in the memoization table, calculate it by recursively calling the function for steps `n-1` and `n-2`, and then store this result in the memoization table.\n",
