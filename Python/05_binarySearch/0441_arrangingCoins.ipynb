    "## Problem Explanation\n",
    "- This problem \"Arranging Coins\" is a classic example of a problem where we are trying to find a specific threshold within a given constraint (_ideal for binary search_)\n",
    "- We are given `n` coins and our task is to form a complete staircase where each level `i` contains `i` coins. \n",
    "- The challenge here is to find the max number of complete rows/levels that can be formed with `n` coins.\n",
    "- The essence of the problems lies in understanding how the total number of coins required scales with the number of complete rows, and finding the point where adding another row would exceed the amount of available coins\n",

    "# Approach 1: Binary Search \n",
    "- Binary search is ideal for this situation because we are trying to find an item in a sorted structure and also trying to determine where that item (_in this case a coin_), should be inserted.\n",
    "- We apply binary search not directly on a collection of elements, but on the possible range of complete rows that can be formed which is `[1,n]`.\n",
    "- The concept behind is that if a certain number of rows `k` requires more than `n` coins, then any number greater than `k` won't fit, so we can safely remove that half of the search space.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intuition\n",
    "- The intuition is that using binary search for this problem comes from the pattern of the total coins needed as we increase the number of rows. \n",
    "- More specifically, the total number of coins needed to form `k` complete rows is given by the sum of the first `k` natural numbers which is $\\frac{k(k+1)}{2}$.\n",
    "- Also since we know that we can guess a middle point `mid` in our search range, we can calculate the coins needed up to that point, and then adjust our search range whether we have too many or too few coins to reach that `mid` point.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm\n",
    "1. **Initialize** two pointers `l` and `r` to represent the search range, starting form `1` to `n` respectively.\n",
    "2. **Binary Search loop:** loop until `l` is less than or equal to `r`.\n",
    "    - Calculate `mid` as the average of `l` and `r`.\n",
    "    - Calculate the total coins needed to form `mid` rows via the formula `(mid * (mid+1) / 2)`.\n",
    "    - If the total coins needed is more than `n`, we need fewer rows, so we can adjust `r` to `mid - 1`.\n",
    "    - Else, we need to form more rows, so adjust `l` to `mid+1` and also update `res` to be the maximum of `mid` and the current `res`.\n",
    "3. **Return** `res` as the max number of complete rows.\n"

    "\n",
    "## Algorithm\n",
    "1. We start by setting up the equation as $\\frac{k(k+1)}{2} = n$. This can then be simplified to $k^2 +k -2n=0$\n",
    "2. By applying the quadratic formula, we get: $k = (-b \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a})$, where we know $a=1$, $b=1$ and $c=-2n$. We also only consider the positive solution since `k` can't be negative.\n",
    "3. After simplifying, we get $k= \\sqrt{2n +0.25} -0.5$\n",
    "4. We can then use the floor of `k` which gives us the largest integer `k` such that $\\frac{k(k+1)}{2} \\leq n$, which is equal to the number complete of rows that can be built with `n` coins."
