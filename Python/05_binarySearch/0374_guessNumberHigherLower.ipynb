    "## Problem Explanation\n",
    "- For this problem, we are given a scenario of a guessing game where an \"opponent\" (the system) selects a number between 1 and `n`, and we must guess the number.\n",
    "- Each time we make a guess, the adversary will indicate whether we are guessing too high, too low, or correct. \n",
    "- The feedback should help us narrow the possible number until we guess the correct number. This is essentially a binary search problem in disguise, since the feedback is asking us to adjust our search.\n",

    "# Approach: Binary Search\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intuition\n",
    "- The intuition behind using search for this problems lies in the way the feedback is provided for each guess. Since the response does tell us if a number is higher or lower, we can effectively eliminate half the search space each time we make a guess.\n",
    "- This problem follows the essence of binary search: dividing the search space in half repeatedly until we reach our desired target/guess.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm\n",
    "1. **Initialize:** Start with two pointers, `low` (set to 1) and `high` (set to `n`), which defines the range of possible numbers.\n",
    "2. **Binary Search Loop:**\n",
    "    - First calculate the midpoint `mid` as the average of `low` and `high` to make a guess.\n",
    "    - We'll use the `guess(mid)` API to check our guess:\n",
    "        - If `guess(mid)` returns `0`, we've guessed correctly, and `mid` is the number.\n",
    "        - If `guess(mid)` returns `-1`, the target number is lower than `mid`, so we'll adjust the high boundary to be `mid - 1`.\n",
    "        - If `guess(mid)` returns `1`, the target number is higher than `mid`, so we'll adjust `low` boundary to `mid + 1`\n",
    "    - Repeat this process until we find the number."
