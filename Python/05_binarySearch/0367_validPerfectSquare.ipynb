    "# Approach 1: Binary Search \n",
    "Using binary search for this problem is ideal since we can divide the search space in half. Since we are looking for a specific integer `x` such that `x * x = num`, we can use binary search to narrow down the range of possible values for `x`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intuition\n",
    "- The intuition for using binary search comes from the ordered nature of perfect squares. s numbers increase, their squares also increase, and this relationship is strictly monotonic.\n",
    "- Thus, if we can compare the square of a middle number in our search range with the target number `num`, we can narrow our search to the left (for smaller numbers) or to the right (for larger numbers) to narrow down the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm\n",
    "1. Initialize two pointers, `l` (left) and `r` (right), to represent the range of possible squares.\n",
    "2. While `l` is than or equal to `r`:\n",
    "    - Compute the midpoint `mid` of the current range.\n",
    "    - Calculate `mid * mid` and compare it to `num`.\n",
    "    - If `mid * mid` is greater than `num`, move the right pointer `r` to `mid-1` (_square root is smaller_)\n",
    "    - If `mid * mid` is less than num, move the left pointer `l` to `mid+1` (_square root is larger)\n",
    "    - If `mid * mid` is equal to `num`, return `True`, indicating that `num` is a perfect square.\n",
    "3. If the loop completes without finding a perfect square, return `False`."

    "# Approach 2: Newton's Method\n",
    "Another approach to the problem is by using Newton's Method which is an iterative method that's used to find approximations of the roots of real-valued functions. In our case, we're going to use it to approximate the square root of the the given number `num`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intuition\n",
    "- The core concept behind using Newton's Method is to start with an initial guess and iteratively improve the guess by moving closer to the actual root.\n",
    "- For the square root, each iteration aims to find a value `x` such that $x^2$ is as close to `num` as possible, without surpassing it. \n",
    "- The method will then converge quickly to an accurate approximation of the square root even if the number is large.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Math Background \n",
    "Newton's Method is used for finding increasingly accurate approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function. The method is based on the idea that a function can be locally approximated as a straight line. If you have an initial guess $x_0$ for a root of the function $f(x)$, you can use the tangent line at $f(x_0)$ to get a better approximation $x_1$ of the root. The process is iterative, with each step defined by the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $x_n$ is the current guess,\n",
    "- $f'(x_n)$ is the derivative of $f$ at $x_n$,\n",
    "- $x_{n+1}$ is the next guess.\n",
    "For finding a square root of a number $a$, we want to solve $f(x) = x^2 - a = 0$. Applying Newton's formula gives:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{x_n^2 - a}{2x_n} = \\frac{1}{2}(x_n + \\frac{a}{x_n})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the formula used in the algorithm, where each iteration updates the guess $x_n$ to get closer to the square root of $a$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm\n",
    "1. **Base cases:** Check if num is less than `2`. If so, return `True` since `1` is a perfect square.\n",
    "2. Initialize `x` with `num // 2`, which is a decent guess since its the mid point.\n",
    "3. **Iterate with Newton's approximation**:\n",
    "    - Update `x` to `(x + num // x) // 2`. This formula is derived from the Newton-Raphson method for finding square roots.\n",
    "4. **Repeat the iteration** until `x * x` is not greater than `num`. This means that `x` is now a close approximation of the square root `num`.\n",
    "5. After exiting the loop, check if `x*x == num` to determine if `num` is a perfect square."
