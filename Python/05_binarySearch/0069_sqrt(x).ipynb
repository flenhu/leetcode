    "- This approach leverages recursion combined with bit shifts to narrow down the search space for the square root.\n",
    "- It has a time complexity of $O(log n)$ and a space complexity of $O(\\log n)$ due to the recursive calls on the stack.\n",
    "- While efficient in terms of time complexity, it has a higher space complexity compared to the other approaches.\n",

    "### Approach 3: Newton's Method\n",
    "- This approach uses an iterative root-finding algorithm based on Newton's Method to approximate the square root.\n",
    "- It has a time complexity of $O(\\log n)$ and a space complexity of $O(1)$.\n",
    "- Newton's Method is known for its rapid convergence, making it an accurate and efficient solution for this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the three approaches, **Newton's Method** is arguably the most optimal because:\n",
    "- **Rapid Convergence:** It typically requires fewer iterations to converge to a sufficient approximation of the square root compared to binary search.\n",
    "- **Accuracy:** It directly computes the square root without needing to discretely search the solution space, making it more adaptable to variations where higher precision might be required.\n",
