    "# Approach 1: Sliding Window\n",

    "\n",

    "- If the end of `haystack` is reached without finding a match, we return `-1`.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Algorithm\n",
    "1. **Check for Edge Cases:** If `needle` is empty, return 0, since an empty string is always found at the first position.\n",
    "2. **Sliding Window:** Iterate over `haystack` with a window size equal to the length of `needle`. For each position:\n",
    "    - Compare the substring of `haystack` within the window to `needle`.\n",
    "    - If they match, return the starting index of the current window in `haystack`.\n",
