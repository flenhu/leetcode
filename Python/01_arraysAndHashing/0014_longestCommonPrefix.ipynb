    "# Approach 1: Horizontal Scanning \n",
    "- The horizontal scanning approach involves comparing the prefixes of the strings one by one.\n",
    "- We will initially consider the whole of the first string as the longest common prefix.\n",
    "- Then, we will iterate over the other strings, truncating the prefix as needed to ensure it's common across all the other strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuition\n",
    "- The main idea behind this approach is to build the longest common prefix step by step, reducing its length if needed.\n",
    "- It's similar to aligning strings horizontally and scanning them from left to right, cutting the prefix to fit all the strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm\n",
    "1. Initialize the prefix as the entire first string.\n",
    "2. Iterate over the other strings in the array.\n",
    "3. For each string, check its current character against the character at the same position \n",
    "    - If they differ or if the end of either the string or prefix is reached, truncate the prefix to the current length\n",
    "4. Return the prefix after iterating over all strings."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison of Approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Horizontal Scanning:\n",
    "- **Strategy**: Compares prefixes of strings one by one, adjusting the prefix until it matches across all strings.\n",
    "- **Best Suited For**: Scenarios with fewer strings or when the common prefix is expected to be relatively long.\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: $O(S)$, where $S$ is the sum of all characters in all strings.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: $O(1)$, constant space usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Vertical Scanning:\n",
    "- **Strategy**: Compares characters column by column across all strings, moving to the next character only when all strings match.\n",
    "- **Best Suited For**: Cases with many strings or strings of significantly varying lengths.\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: $O(S)$, similar to horizontal scanning, but can be more efficient for varied-length strings.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: $O(1)$, also constant space usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Thoughts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Problem Solving Insight**: The choice of approach depends on the characteristics of the input. While both have similar worst-case time complexities, their practical performance can differ based on input patterns.\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: Both methods are space-efficient, using only constant extra space. The decision between them hinges more on the expected input.\n",
    "- **Scalability**: These methods scale well for most practical purposes. Alternative methods like divide and conquer or binary search might be considered for very specific or extremely large datasets.\n",
    "- **Variability in Problem Solving**: This problem illustrates how a simple task can have multiple efficient solutions, each with its own advantages and trade-offs."
