    "- An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once.\n",
    "- For instance, \"bat\" and \"tab\" are anagrams. \n",
    "- The task is to create groups of anagrams from the given array of strings and return them in a list of lists.\n",

    "# Approach 1: Character Count \n",
    "A solid approach to tackling this problem is counting the frequency of each character in a string and using that count as a key to group anagrams.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intuition\n",
    "- The intuition behind this approach is that two strings are anagrams if and only if their character counts (for each letter) are the same. \n",
    "- Instead of sorting the strings to check if they are anagrams, we can count the occurrences of each character. \n",
    "- This count, represented as a tuple of 26 elements (for each letter in the English alphabet), serves as a unique identifier for each group of anagrams.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm\n",
    "1. **Initialize:** a dictionary (hashmap) to store the lists of anagrams, where the keys will be the unique character count tuples and the values will be the lists of strings that share the same character count.\n",
    "2. **Iterate over each string in the input list**\n",
    "3. **Count characters:** For each string, create a count of 26 zeroes, one for each letter. Then, increment the count for each character in the string.\n",
    "4. **Group anagrams:** Use the tuple of counts as a key in the dictionary. Then append the current string to the list corresponding to this key.\n",
    "5. **Return Groups:** Since the dictionary's values hold the grouped anagrams, we can return those."

    "# Final Conclusion\n",
    "The \"Group Anagrams\" problem is a classic example of categorization based on string properties, where the challenge is to group strings that are anagrams of each other. An anagram involves rearranging the letters of a word or phrase to form another, using all the original letters exactly once.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach 1: Character Count\n",
    "This method involves creating a character frequency count for each string, using this count as a unique identifier to group anagrams. It's efficient because it directly compares the composition of the strings without altering their content.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Characteristics:** Utilizes character count as a direct comparison metric, avoids sorting.  \n",
    "**Complexity:** Time complexity is O(NK), and space complexity is O(NK), making it highly efficient, especially for strings of moderate length.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach 2: Categorize by Sorted String\n",
    "Approach 2 sorts each string and uses the sorted string as a key in a defaultdict to group anagrams. It's straightforward and intuitive, relying on the fact that anagrams will always sort into the same sequence of characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Characteristics:** Leverages sorting for easy group identification, intuitive and simple to implement.  \n",
    "**Complexity:** With a time complexity of O(NKlogK) and space complexity of O(NK), it's slightly less efficient than Approach 1 due to the sorting operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach 2.1: Sorting and Hashing (A slight variation of Approach 2)\n",
    "Approach 2.1 is essentially the same as Approach 2, categorizing by sorted strings. The slight variation might be in implementation details, but the core idea and the algorithms' complexities remain the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Characteristics:** Identical in logic to Approach 2, variations may lie in code semantics or structure.  \n",
    "**Complexity:** Shares the same complexity analysis as Approach 2 - O(NKlogK) for time and O(NK) for space.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparison and Efficiency\n",
    "- Approach 1 is generally more efficient for strings of moderate length due to its linear complexity with respect to the length of the strings. It avoids the overhead of sorting, making it faster for large datasets.  \n",
    "- Approaches 2 and 2.1 are more intuitive and straightforward, making the solution easier to understand and implement at the cost of slightly higher time complexity due to sorting. These approaches are particularly effective when the maximum string length (K) is relatively small, as the sorting overhead becomes negligible.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Most Efficient Approach\n",
    "For large datasets with relatively short strings, Approaches 2 and 2.1 offer a good balance of efficiency and simplicity.  \n",
    "When dealing with longer strings or aiming for maximum performance, Approach 1 (Character Count) is more efficient due to its lower time complexity and direct approach to comparing string compositions.  \n",
    "Both sorting-based approaches (2 and 2.1) and the character count approach (1) provide valuable techniques for solving problems involving string manipulation and categorization, with the choice of approach depending on specific problem constraints and performance requirements.\n"
