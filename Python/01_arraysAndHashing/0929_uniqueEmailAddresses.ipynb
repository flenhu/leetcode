    "- For this problem, we are given a list of email addresses.\n",
    "- Each email consists of two parts:\n",
    "    1. A local name\n",
    "    2. A domain name  \n",
    "    These are separated by an `@` symbol.\n",
    "- The goal is to count how many unique email addresses are actually receiving emails, when considering the following rules:\n",
    "    1. **Dots in Local Name**: Dots `\".\"` in the local name are ignored.\n",
    "        - For eaxmple: `\"alice.z\"` and `\"alicez\"` in the local name equivalent.\n",
    "    2. **Plus Sign in the Local Name**: Everything after a `\"+\"` in the local name is ignored. \n",
    "        - For example: `\"my+name\"` is just treated as `\"my\"`\n",
    "    3. **Domain Name Unchanged**: The rules for the local name don't apply to the domain name.\n",

    "# Approach 1: String Split Method\n",
    "The String Split Method involves splitting the email into its local and domain parts, processing the local part according to the rules, and then combining it back with the domain part.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intuition\n",
    "- The intuition behind using the String Split Method lies in utilizing built-in functions such as `split` and `replace`. These functions are:  \n",
    "    - **`split()`**:\n",
    "        - this function is used to divide the email strings into their respective parts: the local and domain names.\n",
    "        - It breaks the string around the `\"@\"` character for separating the two parts, then around the `\"+\"` in the local part to discard the irrelevant portions.\n",
    "    - **`replace()`**:\n",
    "        - This method is utilized to handle the rule about ignoring the dots in the local name.\n",
    "        - It replaces the occurences of the dot character `\".\"` with and empty string.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm\n",
    "1. ** Initialize a Set**: This is to store the unique email addresses.\n",
    "2. ** Process Each Email**:\n",
    "    - Split the email into local and domain parts.\n",
    "    - In the local part, remove everything after the first plus `\"+\"` and all dots `\".\"`\n",
    "    - Combine the newly processed local part with the domain part.\n",
    "3. **Add Processed Email to the Set**: This ensures the uniqueness of the emails.\n",
    "4. **Return the count** The number of unique emails is the size of the set."
