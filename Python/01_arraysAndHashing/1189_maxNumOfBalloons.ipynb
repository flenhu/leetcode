    "# Approach 1: Counting Characters\n",
    "The probably most natural approach is to count how often each character appears in text and then determining the maximum number of times \"balloon\" can be formed based on those counts. Since \"balloon\" requires:\n",
    "- 1 `'b'`\n",
    "- 1 `'a'`\n",
    "- 2 `'l'`'s\n",
    "- 2 `'o'`'s\n",
    "- 1 `'n'`'\n",
    "\n",
    "The limiting factor in forming `\"balloon\"` will be the availability of these characters in text, particularly `'l'` and `'o'`, which are needed twice.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intuition\n",
    "- The intuition behind this approach is basically recognizing that the ability to form `\"balloon\"` is directly tied to the frequency of its constituent characters in text.\n",
    "- The characters 'l' and 'o' are critical because they are required more than once. Hence, their availability significantly impacts the overall count of \"balloon\" instances that can be formed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm\n",
    "1. **Count Characters:** Use a counter to tally the occurences of each character in `text` and also for balloon.\n",
    "2. **Determine Minimum Ratio:**\n",
    "    - Iterate through characters in `\"balloon\"`, comparing their counts in text to their occurrence in `\"balloon\"` to find the limiting character. \n",
    "    - This is done by calculating the floor division of counts in text by counts in \"balloon\" for each character and taking the minimum.\n",
    "3. **Result:** The minimum ratio found indicates the maximum number of \"balloon\" instances that can be formed."
