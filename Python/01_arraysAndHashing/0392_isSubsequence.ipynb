    "# Approach: Two Pointer\n",

    "\n",
    "### Intuition\n",
    "- **Sequential Matching**: A subsequence maintains the order of the characters. So, we need to check if the characters in `s` appear in the same order in `t`.\n",
    "- **Pointer for Each String**: We use one pointer for `s` and another for `t`. Then, we move through `t`, and for each matching character in `s`, we'll advance the pointer in `s`.\n",
    "- **Completion Check**: If we reach the end of `s` (meaning all characters in `s` are found in `t` in order), `s` is a subsequence of `t`.\n",

    "1. Initilaize two pointers: `i` (for `s`) and `j` (for `t`) at 0.\n",
    "2. While both pointers are within their respective strings:\n",
    "    - If the characters at the two pointers match (`s[i] == t[j]`), increment `i`.\n",
    "    - Increment `j` in every iteration.\n",
    "3. After the loop, check if `i` is equal to the length of `s`.\n",
    "    - If `i == len(s)`, all characters of `s` were found in `t` in order, so return `True`.\n",
    "    - Otherwise, return `False`.\n",
