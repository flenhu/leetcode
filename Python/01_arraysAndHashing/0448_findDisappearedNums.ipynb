    "# Approach 1 : In-Place Modification (most-efficient)\n",
    "- The in-place modification approach uses the array itself to mark the presence of the numbers. \n",
    "- Since we know the numbers are within a specific range (`1` to `n`), we can use the indices of the array as a \"natural hash-map\" where the presence of a number is marked by modifying the lement at the corresponding index.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intuition\n",
    "- The intution behind this approach is recognizing that if a number `x` is present in teh array, then the number `x` can be used to mark the index `x-1` (considering 0-based indexing).\n",
    "- By negating the value at index `x-1`, we can indicate that `x` has been seen.\n",
    "- After we process all the numbers, the indices with positive values indicate the numbers that are missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm\n",
    "1. Iterate through the array, using each number to access its coresponding index (`nums[i]-1` due to 0-based indexing).\n",
    "2. Negate the value at this index if it's not already negative, marking that the number already exists.\n",
    "3. After marking the numbers, iterate through the array once more. Inidices with positive values indicate the missing numbers `(index + 1)`"
