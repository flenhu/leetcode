    "- `ParkingSystem(int big, int medium, int small)` Initializes object of the ParkingSystem class. The number of slots for each parking space are given as part of the constructor.\n",
    "- `bool addCar(int carType)` Checks whether there is a parking space of `carType` for the car that wants to get into the parking lot. `carType` can be of three kinds: big, medium, or small, which are represented by `1`, `2`, and `3` respectively. **A car can only park in a parking space of its** `carType`. If there is no space available, return false, else park the car in that size space and return true.\n",

    "## Intuition\n",
    "- Using direct attributes for each park space size depending on the car (big, medium, small) provides a straightforward way to track the number of available slots. \n",
    "- This approach is intuitive because it directly reflects the real-world scenario of having a specific number of parking spots for each size category.\n",

    "## Algorithm\n",
    "1. **Initialization:** Store the number of slots for each car size as separate attributes in the constructor.\n",
    "2. **Add car:** \n",
    "    - When a car requests to park, check if there is an available slot for its size.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "### Direct Attributes Approach:\n",
    "- **Simplicity:** This method directly maps the problem statement to the class structure, using individual attributes for each car size. It's straightforward and easy to understand.\n",
    "- **Direct Access:** Parking slots are managed through direct attributes, making access and updates slightly faster due to the absence of an intermediary data structure like a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dictionary-Based Tracking Approach:\n",
    "- **Flexibility:** Using a dictionary to track parking spaces and their capacities allows for a more dynamic structure. Adding or modifying vehicle types involves simple updates to the dictionary, making this approach more scalable.\n",
    "- **Encapsulation**: This method encapsulates the state of each parking slot type within a single structure, which can be advantageous for managing larger datasets or more complex systems.\n",
    "- **Complexity**: Although slightly more complex due to the use of a dictionary, this approach offers a balanced trade-off between flexibility and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Thoughts\n",
    "- The **Direct Attributes** Approach is ideal for scenarios with a fixed and small number of categories. It's simple and very direct, making it a great choice for problems with clearly defined and unchanging parameters.\n",
    "- The **Dictionary-Based Tracking** Approach shines in scenarios where scalability and adaptability are crucial. It allows for easy adjustments and can handle more complex requirements without significant changes to the underlying logic."
