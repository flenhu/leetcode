    "##  Approach 1: One Pass Min-Max\n",
    "The key intuition for this approach is to solve the problem in a single pass through the `prices` array, by focusing on two main aspects:\n",
    "1. Tracking the lowest buying price:\n",
    "    - As we go through each day, we aim to find the lowest price seen so far. This lowest price represents the best window to buy the stock up to that point.\n",
    "2. Calculating the max profit at each step:\n",
    "    - For each day, after updating the lowest price, we then want to calculate the potential profit that could be made if we were to sell the stock on that day. \n",
    "    - The idea is to continually assess: \"If I had bought the stock at the lowest price so far and sold it today, would I be maximizing by bag?\"\n",
    "    - Then we want to update the max  profit if it indeed higher than the max profit we've seen so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general this approach ensures we are aware of the best time to buy (lowest price so far) and also the best time to sell (maximum of profit so far). Essentially, this is a single pass through the array and we are constantly updating these two variables to find the best window/profit."
