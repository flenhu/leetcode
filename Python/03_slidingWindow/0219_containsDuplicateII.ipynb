    "- We can utilize hash tables in our approach since we can leverage using a dynamic set to keep track of a sliding window of elements that can be up to size $k$. \n",
    "- This window then moves through the array, and we can maintain a record of the elements within the distance constraint at a given time.\n",

    "- The intuition behind using a hash table (or a set) is its ability to quickly check for the existence of an element.\n",

    "1. **Initialize an empty set**, let's call it `window`, to represent the sliding wundow of elements within distance `k`.\n",

    "    - Check if the current element `nums[R]` is in the `window`:\n",
    "        - If it is in the window, return `True` as a duplicate within the required distance is found.\n",
    "        - Otherwise if its not in the window, add `nums[R]` to the window.\n",

    "For this problem, we can go about approaching it in several ways:\n",
    "1. **Brute Force/Naive Linear Search:** Check each element against the otheres within the distance `k`, which leads to a potentially high computational cost, especially for large arrays and values of `k`.\n",
    "2. **Hash Table:** We can use a hash table/dictionary to keep track of the last seen indices of elements, which allows for efficient checks/lookups for nearby duplicates.\n",
    "3. **Binary Search Tree (BST):** While a BST could be used to maintain a sorted structure of the last `k` elements, allowing for $O(\\log{k})$ insertions and deletions, its complexity in handling duplicates and the overhead of maintaining tree balance make it less practical than a hash table.\n",
    "### Why using a hash table/dictionary is the way\n",
    "- **Effiency:** Using a hash table significantly reduces the time complexity $O(n)$ from the $O(n\\min{(k,n)})$ we get with the naive linear search approach or even using a BST. This effiency comes from the fact that a hash table is able to perform constant-time lookups and updates, which enables faster checks for duplicates within the require range of `k`.\n",
    "- **Scalability:** Hash tables are suited for scaling large data sets. Unlike naive linear search which slows down dramatically when the data size increases or BSTs which require more overhead management, hash tables are able to maintain consistent performance."
