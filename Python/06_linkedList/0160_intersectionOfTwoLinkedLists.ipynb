    "Given the heads of two singly linked-lists `headA` and `headB`, return the node at which the two lists intersect. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return `null`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node `c1`:\n",
    "![ex](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/05/160_statement.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note** that the linked lists must **retain their original structure** after the function returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Custom Judge:\n",
    "The inputs to the **judge** are given as follows (your program is **not** given these inputs):\n",
    "- `intersectVal` - The value of the node where the intersection occurs. This is 0 if there is no intersected node.\n",
    "- `listA` - The first linked list.\n",
    "- `listB` - The second linked list.\n",
    "- `skipA` - The number of nodes to skip ahead in `listA` (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.\n",
    "- `skipB` - The number of nodes to skip ahead in `listB` (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.\n",
    "\n",
    "The judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and pass the two heads, `headA` and `headB` to your program. If you correctly return the intersected node, then your solution will be accepted.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1:\n",
    "![ex1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/05/160_example_1_1.png)\n",
    "> **Input:** `intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3`  \n",
    "> **Output:** `Intersected at '8'`  \n",
    "> **Explanation:** The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).  \n",
    "> From the head of `A`, it reads as `[4,1,8,4,5]`. From the head of `B`, it reads as `[5,6,1,8,4,5]`. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in `A`; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in `B`.  \n",
    "> - Note that the intersected node's value is not 1 because the nodes with value 1 in `A` and `B` (2nd node in `A` and 3rd node in `B`) are different node references. In other words, they point to two different locations in memory, while the nodes with value 8 in `A` and `B` (3rd node in `A` and 4th node in `B`) point to the same location in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2:\n",
    "![ex2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/05/160_example_2.png)\n",
    "> **Input:** `intersectVal = 2, listA = [1,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1`  \n",
    "> **Output:** `Intersected at '2'`  \n",
    "> **Explanation:** The intersected node's value is `2` (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).  \n",
    "> From the head of `A`, it reads as `[1,9,1,2,4]`. From the head of `B`, it reads as `[3,2,4]`. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in `A`; There are 1 node before the intersected node in `B`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 3:\n",
    "![ex3](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/05/160_example_3.png)\n",
    "> **Input:** `intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2`  \n",
    "> **Output:** `No intersection`  \n",
    "> **Explanation:** From the head of `A`, it reads as `[2,6,4]`. From the head of `B`, it reads as `[1,5]`. Since the two lists do not intersect, `intersectVal` must be `0`, while `skipA` and `skipB` can be arbitrary values.  \n",
    "Since the two lists do not intersect, so return `null`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Constraints:\n",
    "- The number of nodes of `listA` is in the `m`.\n",
    "- The number of nodes of `listB` is in the `n`.\n",
    "- `1 <= m, n <= 3 * 10^4`\n",
    "- `1 <= Node.val <= 10^5`\n",
    "- `0 <= skipA < m`\n",
    "- `0 <= skipB < n`\n",
    "- `intersectVal` is 0 if `listA` and `listB` do not intersect.\n",
    "- `intersectVal == listA[skipA] == listB[skipB]` if `listA` and `listB` intersect."
