    "### Problem Explanation\n",
    "- The \"Merge Two Sorted Lists\" problem involves merging two sorted link lists (`list1` and `list2`) into a single sorted linked list.\n",
    "- The newly formed merged list should be formed by combining the nodes of the two input lists without creating new nodes.\n",
    "- This can be handled by either an recursive or iterative approach."

    "## Approach 1: Recursion\n",
    "### Intuition\n",
    "- The recursive approach defines the merge operation as repeatedly selecting the smaller of the two list heads and merging teh rest of the elements accordingly. \n",
    "- This method handles the merging process without needing to manage too many edge cases, which effectively breaks down a larger problem into the more manageable bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm\n",
    "1. **Base Cases**: If either `list1` or `list2` is null, return the non-null list.\n",
    "2. **Select the smaller head**: Determine which of `list1` or `list2` has a smaller head.\n",
    "3. **Recursive merge**: Set the `next` of the smaller head to the result of a recursive call, passing the next element of the smaller list and the other list.\n",
    "4. **Return**: Return the smaller head as the new head of the merged list. This process will then continue until both lists reach their end."
