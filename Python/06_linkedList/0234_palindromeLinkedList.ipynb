    "# Approach 1: Reverse Second Half In-place\n",
    "This approach involves reversing the second half of the linked list in-place and then comparing the first half with the reversed second half to check if the entire list is a palindrome. In, summary this approach is essentially 3 main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Finding the Middle of the List:** Use a fast and slow pointer technique to find the middle of the list (_or the start of the second half for even length lists_).\n",
    "2. **Reversing the Second Half of the List:** Reverse the second half of the list in-place so that we can easily compare it with the first half.\n",
    "3. **Checking for Palindrome:** Compare the first half and the reversed second half node by node. If all corresponding nodes are equal, the list is a palindrome.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intuition\n",
    "- The core idea behind this approach is that if a list is a palindrome, the second half of the list is the mirror image of the first half. \n",
    "- By reversing the second half, it's more straightforward to compare it with the first half. \n",
    "- The fast and slow pointer method efficiently finds the middle of the list, avoiding the need for counting nodes or using extra space.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm\n",
    "1. **Finding the middle:**\n",
    "    - Initialize two pointers, `fast` and `slow`, both pointing to the `head`. \n",
    "    - Move `fast` by two steps and `slow` by one step in each iteration. \n",
    "    - When fast reaches the end, slow will be at the midpoint.\n",
    "2. **Reverse second half:** \n",
    "    - Initialize a `prev` pointer as `None`. \n",
    "    - Iteratively reverse the links in the second half of the list, using `slow` to traverse it.\n",
    "3. **Check Palindrome:**\n",
    "    - Reset pointers `left` to `head` and `right` to `prev` (_start of the reversed second half_). \n",
    "    - Compare the values of nodes pointed by `left` and `right` until `right` is `None`. \n",
    "    - If all corresponding values match, return `True`; otherwise, `False`."

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "We covered three different approaches to solve the Palindrome Linked List problem:\n",
    "### Approach 1: Reverse Second Half In-place\n",
    "- This approach involves finding the middle of the linked list, reversing the second half in-place, and then comparing the first half with the reversed second half.\n",
    "- It has a time complexity of $O(n)$ and a space complexity of $O(1)$, making it efficient in both time and space.\n",
    "- This approach is considered the most optimal solution as it modifies the linked list in-place without using any additional data structures, resulting in constant space complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach 2: Copy into List and then Use Two Pointers\n",
    "- This approach copies the values of the linked list into a list (array) and then uses the two-pointer technique to check if the list is a palindrome.\n",
    "- It has a time complexity of $O(n)$ and a space complexity of $O(n)$ due to the additional list created to store the values.\n",
    "- While this approach is simple and easy to understand, it has a higher space complexity compared to the Reverse Second Half In-place approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach 3: Recursion\n",
    "- This approach uses recursion to traverse the linked list from both ends simultaneously and compare the values of the corresponding nodes.\n",
    "- It has a time complexity of $O(n)$ and a space complexity of $O(n)$ due to the recursive calls on the call stack.\n",
    "- While concise and avoids explicit reversal or copying values, this approach may be less intuitive and has a higher space complexity compared to the Reverse Second Half In-place approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among these three approaches, the Reverse Second Half In-place approach is considered the most optimal solution for the Palindrome Linked List problem. It achieves both time and space efficiency, with a time complexity of $O(n)$ and a constant space complexity of $O(1)$. By modifying the linked list in-place, it avoids the need for additional data structures, making it memory-efficient."
